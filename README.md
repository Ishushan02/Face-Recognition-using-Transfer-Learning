# Face-Recognition-using-Transfer-Learning
This repository is an implementation of Image Classification using Transfer Learning. I have used InceptionV3 pretrained model and modified the the outut layers to 6. In this example I have classified images of Elon Musk, Narendra Modi, Bill Gates, Jack Maa and Donald Trump. It also contains a negative image class to balance the images of Person other than all these and as well as to increase the accuracy of the model.
